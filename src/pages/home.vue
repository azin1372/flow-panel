            <p>
    
                Flow is a blockchain-based decentralized ecosystem and platform with scaling solutions for interactive experiences, decentralized application projects, and blockchain-<br /> based games. The Flow network focuses on providing a scalable environment
    
                and architecture for fast transactions without congestion, to create an environment for<br /> non-fungible tokens, dApps, and games. NFTs can be created and traded as well as other cryptocurrencies, while the crucial difference is that every
    
                NFT is unique and<br /> has a different price, which is why NFTs are known as collectibles.<br /> Flow has its own project on the network, NBA Top Shot, and as the NFT market is booming, Flow could experience rising popularity as well. Flow
    
                offers upgradable <br /> smart contracts that can be patched to fix any bugs, a finality that is achieved in seconds, and an easy way to build dApps and create NFTs with Flow's easy-to-learn <br /> programming language, Cadence.<br /> Flow
    
                resolves problems with scalability seen on the Ethereum platform without the use of sharding, instead of employing the efficient Proof of Stake protocol. That is <br /> how Flow enables the smooth running of operations and minimizes congestion
    
                on the network for dApps and blockchain games such as CryptoKitties.<br />
    
            </p>
    
            <h2 class="mt-10">How Does Flow Work?</h2>
    
            <p>
    
                Flow uses the Proof of Stake protocol to achieve scalability without the use of sharding, which is a common scaling technique for increasing speed and network <br /> capacity. Flow distributes the work on the network across the nodes that
    
                support the system, with different nodes assigned different tasks based on their technical <br /> capabilities. An increased blockchain throughput is achieved by separating non-deterministic processes (e.g. forming transactions into a block)
    
                from deterministic ones <br /> (e.g. executing that block of transactions).<br />
    
            </p>
    
            <h2 class="mt-10">Who Are the Founders of Flow? (History of Flow)</h2>
    
            <p>
    
                The Flow project was founded by Dapper Labs, which is the same team that is responsible for developing one of the most popular dApps and blockchain games hosted<br /> on Ethereum, CryptoKitties. CryptoKitties experienced huge popularity and
    
                still continues to attract blockchain enthusiasts and fans of blockchain-based collectibles.<br /> With the increasing number of users, Ethereum proved to have issues with scalability, so CryptoKitties faced problems with operations, which
    
                is why the Dapper Labs <br /> team decided to create a scalable blockchain platform that would represent a highly functional environment for dApps and games such as CryptoKitties â€“ Flow.<br />
